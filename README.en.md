## Works

### Ecoresponsible alternatives

In parallel, I created two very different *side projects*, but sharing the same goal: to be, in their respective fields, **a powerful alternative to other technically disproportionate solutions**.

WordsMatter | cirrus
------------ | -------------
Write from the web application; share with the API. WordsMatter is a 100% autonomous, open-source and free blog management module. Its efficiency makes it an eco-responsible alternative to traditional content management systems (CMS). | A cirrus cloud is a type of cloud having inherited its Latin name from the shape it recalls, that of a curl of hair. Beyond the poetic aspect, cirrus is the ideal acronym for the Integrated, Responsible and Resilient Cloud project for Sagaces Users carried by Awebsome. (private for now)

## Other works

bookmarker (web extension) | hyperlynx (web extension) |  chess (*librairy*)
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Increase productivity, save the planet. With [bookmarker](https://github.com/AwebsomeFr/bookmarker), personalize and group your bookmakers (favorites) by folder, quickly target your favorite addresses or access to the web with the integrated search engines. | Don't be surprised anymore: [hyperlynx](https://github.com/AwebsomeFr/hyperlynx) identifies for you any hyperlink pointing to a domain outside the visited site. | Create HTML Elements Short Syntax. Or [chess](https://github.com/AwebsomeFr/chess), for close friends.
