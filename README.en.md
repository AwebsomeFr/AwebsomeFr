My name is **Julien Wilhelm**. **Ecoresponsible web developer** & **consultant in digital sobriety** as a **freelance**, my job reflects some values that matter for me. 

With [Awebsome](https://awebsome.fr), I defend **sobriety**, **inclusion** and **digital diversity**. I design **eco-responsible web solutions** for any type of structure wishing to embark on the path of responsible 🌿️, efficient 🚀️ and resilient 🛡️ digital. I also intervene, outside the code and in different forms, in order to make as many people as possible aware of the **environmental and societal challenges of digital technology**. 

Living in **Brittany**, my clients are both **locals** and **europeans**.

My services:
- 🌱️ Advice to professionals on eco-responsible web solutions. 
- 🚀 Front-end / back-end development of customized and efficient websites and web applications. 
- 🎙️ Conferences / Awareness around Responsible Digital and Digital Sobriety issues.
- 🔎 Web audits (technical efficiency & performance, overall accessibility & ergonomics). 
- ☁️ cirrus installator | Cloud Intègre, Responsable et Résilient pour Utilisateurs Sagaces.

My qualities:
- 👌 A strong appetite for a job well done.
- 💪 Many transversal skills.
- 🤝 Appreciable human qualities.
- 👂 An exemplary availability.

In parallel, I created two very different projects, but sharing the same goal: to be, in their respective fields, **a powerful alternative to other technically disproportionate solutions**.

Write from the web application; share with the API. WordsMatter is a 100% autonomous, open-source and free blog management module. Its efficiency makes it an eco-responsible alternative to traditional content management systems (CMS). | A cirrus cloud is a type of cloud having inherited its Latin name from the shape it recalls, that of a curl of hair. Beyond the poetic aspect, cirrus is the ideal acronym for the Integrated, Responsible and Resilient Cloud project for Sagaces Users carried by Awebsome. (private for now)
